            <br/>November 2022
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <i className="text-xl">We are proud to announce that Stock Knowledge, a gamified immersive learning platform, 
            is one of the finalists for the Immersive Experiential Learning Category of the Wharton-QS Reimagine Education Awards. 
            This prestigious event recognizes innovative approaches that enhance student learning outcomes and employability. 
            Stock Knowledge is among the top <b>18%</b> of innovative solutions chosen from over <b>1100</b> applications submitted worldwide.</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            The Wharton-QS Reimagine Education Awards is considered the 'Oscars' of Education. It is an honor to be recognized alongside 
            top universities and private organizations that pioneer technological advancements and pedagogical innovations in education worldwide.

            <br />
            <br />
            Stock Knowledge is a gamified immersive learning platform that utilizes games, <strong><i>augmented reality(AR)</i>, and <i>virtual reality (VR)</i> </strong>
            to make math and science learning more fun, engaging, and effective. The three-dimensional immersive simulation and interaction via AR and VR 
            significantly enhanced the student's understanding of the complex concepts of math and science. Additionally, based on our study and 
            other research, incorporating games into learning can contextualize instructional settings, motivate learners, engage them, and lead to 
            increased learning outcomes and positive attitudes toward math and science.

            <br />
            <br />
            Our solution turns passive learners into active ones and empowers teachers with what they do best, which is teaching. 
            Our solution is an excellent supplement to the existing teaching tools, especially for personalized remote learning. 
            It also lessens students' math and science anxieties through 3D simulated gamified immersive learning and easy association 
            of STEM complex technical concepts to real-life applications. 

            <br />
            <br />
            We are excited to be recognized for our innovative approach to delivering high-quality basic education and grateful for the opportunity to be 
            considered for this prestigious award. Our platform can significantly impact more students and teachers since this is affordable and accessible 
            despite using emerging exponential technologies. SK learning platform can be accessed using a low-spec smartphone with no or low-internet connection. 
            And we look forward to continuing to develop and improve our platform to better serve our users.

            <br />
